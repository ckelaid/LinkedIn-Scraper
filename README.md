# LinkedIn-Scraper

### Quick Overview

This is a LinkedIn Job Scraper I created using BeautifulSoup & Selenium.

The idea behind this scraper is that the user inputs what kind of jobs he/she is looking for, and the scraper scrapes the job information for the jobs listed on the 1st page of the search input.

I began my work by checking this [blog post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/linkedin-scrapper-a3e6790099b5), but ended up personalizing most of the content to my own needs, as many attributes on the post failed to work correctly.
